							<p>The OSH Analytics project is based on the use of open source datasets from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a compilation of Federal Aencies, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).</p>
							<p> </p>
							<p><b>Bureau of Labor Statistics</b><p>
							<p>The two <b>BLS</b> datasets featured aggregate data on both fatal and nonfatal injuries. The variables included age, sex, state, industry, injury descpritors (part of body, type of injury, etc.), and number of hours worked before the injury occurred. These datasets are updated annually, with a two year lag.</p>
							<p>Previously, the BLS data was coded, in long format, and housed in large .txt files. First, OSH Analytics combined the necessary files and then split the resulting huge file into logical separators (Rates, Absolute Case Counts, and Median Days off). Using the smaller files, the team was then able to decode the data and further split the smaller files into even smaller ones (by value type) to ease loading times. Finally, the team converted all the data from long format into wide formatâ€”wide format saves space by eliminating repetitive information found in long format. Doing this allowed the team to make a functional interface that allows users to select the variables from the dataset that they would like to analyze. The interfact creates a graphical representation of the data, so users can easily identify trends.</p>

							<p><b>Federal Agency Data</b><p>
							<p>The Federal Agency data had employee engagement scores, which were calculated by surveying employee sentiments, and the corresponding Lost Time Case Rate (LTCR) with that organization. This dataset was used to create <a href="generic2.html">a predictive model</a>, which will bring tremendous value to Booz Allen's OSH CoP.</p>
