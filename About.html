							<p> What is the Occupational Safety and Health Community of Practice? What is the OSH-CoP's Summer Games Challenge?</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Background The Occupational Safety and Health Community of Practice (OSH-CoP), led by Stephen Buchanan, is a team of over 90 professionals who specialize in identifying hazards, quantifying exposure, and protecting workers.  We are an internal collaborative resource to predict and prevent harm to Booz Allen and client staff in any environment where occupational hazards may be present.  Our long-term focus is growing our business footprint through continued development of Safety and Health functional capabilities.  Key initiatives for 2017 include Prevention Through Design, development of international OSH standards (including ISO 45001, Safety Management Systems), and RiTMS, a predictive risk analytics and resource prioritization tool.  We protect the most precious resource any business can have – it’s People.</p>
							<p>Challenge 4,836 workers died on the job in the in the US in 2015; that’s 13 workers per day who did not come home to their families. These deaths could have been prevented. Private industry reported three out of every 100 workers (2.9 million) suffered nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses in 2015, resulting in payments of $1 billion per week in workers' compensation costs. The total direct and indirect economic impact exceeds $250 billion per year. Numerous large databases are publicly available which provide extensive information on injuries or illnesses that have already occurred, but not enough is being done to analyze these millions of data points to identify ways to keep people from getting sick or injured in the first place.  Applying the power of analytics and data visualization could reveal previously unknown, predictive indicators of occupations, activities, demographics and other factors that contribute to increased risk.</p>  
							<p>Our Summer Games team will develop applications to rapidly query data sets, consolidate and analyze relevant information, and identify improvement opportunities.  Interactive visualizations will display occupational risk factors and show the benefit, both in lives saved and cost avoided, from data-driven, actionable changes.  This will provide safety professionals with the tools to reduce fatalities and improve safety for millions of workers nationwide.  </p>
