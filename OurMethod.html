							<h1>Our Method</h1>
							<p>How did we tackle the challenge?</p>
							<p>The project occurred in stages including data cleaning, analysis, visualization creation, website development, and solutions research.</p>
							<p>  </p>
							<p><b>Data Cleaning</b></p>
							<p><b>BLS Data</b>: The team combined the necessary data files and then split the resulting huge file into logical separators (Rates, Absolute Case Counts, and Median Days off). Using the smaller files, they were then able to decode the data and further split the smaller files into even smaller ones (by value type) to ease loading times. Finally, the team converted all the data from long format into wide formatâ€”wide format saves space by eliminating repetitive information found in long format.</p>
							<p><b>Federal Agency Data</b>: The team combined two datasets that showed LTCR and employee engagement scores to come up with a list of agencies that had recorded numbers for each of those categories. This resulted in a list of 61 agencies.</p>
							<p><b>OSHA Data</b>: The team--- </p>
							<p>  </p>
							<p><b>Analysis</b></p>
							<p>During the analysis stage, the federal agency data was used to create a predictive model.---</p>
							<p>  </p>
							<p><b>Visualization</b></p>
							<p>The team created interactive interfaces in order for users to quickly scan, analyze, and predict trends. There are four main applications, which can all be accessed from the team's website.</p>
							<p>The first application is a graph generator; users can select the dataset and variables from the BLS dataset, and a graph will be created. Through this application, trends are easily identifiable. For example, the team tested this application by looking at the days of the week and time of day, and it found that injuries most often occur on Mondays between 8 am and noon.</p>
							<p>The second application is the LTCR predictive model, which returns the LTCR score based on the employee engagment survey results.</p>
							<p>The third application is a word cloud generator. Users can select the number of words they would like to see on the application, as well as what they would like represented (source of injury, part of body, or nature of injury). The larger the word, the more instances of that source, part of body, or nature of injury there are in the dataset.</p>
							<p>The final application is a map of severe injuries in the United States. Users can click on a region on the map, which will zoom into the state level. Then they can select a city or county region to further investigate. Each instance of an injury will pop up, and the user can read a description of the incident.</p>
							<p>  </p>
							<p><b>Website Development</b></p>
							<p>This website was created to showcase the visualizations. The goal is that this tool will make it easier to transition this project from the Summer Games program to the OSH CoP full time staff.</p>

							<p><b>Solutions Research</b></p>
